def register_decomposition(gate_class, gate_decomposer, gate_recognizer=None):
    """
    Add a decomposition rule for compiling 'gate' to the global setup.

    The decomposition rule is a Decomposition object (see _decomposition.py)
    and consists of a function which recognizes a command (i.e., determines
    whether it can handle it) and a function which executes the decomposition.
    The gate_class parameter determines the gate class for which the
    decomposition is valid (keeps the number of calls to recognize functions
    lower).

    Args:
        gate_class: Gate class for which the decomposition should be
            applicable; this parameter is only used to enable binary search on
            `gate_object.__class__`.

            If your class is defined as

            .. code-block:: python

                class MyGate(BasicGate):
                    pass

            Then you supply gate_class=MyGate
            However, if MyGate is overridden as often is the case when

            .. code-block:: python

                MyGate = MyGate() # allows the syntax MyGate | qubit

            then gate_class = MyGate.__class__
        gate_decomposer (function): Function which, given the command to
            decompose, applies a sequence of gates corresponding to the high-
            level function of a gate of type gate_class.
        gate_recognizer (function): Optional function which, given the command
            to decompose, returns whether the decomposition supports the given
            command. E.g., rotation gates may be rewritten using one
            decomposition for some angles, and another one for other angles.
            If no such function is provided, the decomposition rule will be
            valid for all gates of type gate_class.

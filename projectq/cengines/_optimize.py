    LocalOptimizer is a compiler engine which optimizes locally (merging
    rotations, cancelling gates with their inverse) in a local window of user-

    gate pipeline. After adding a gate, it tries to merge / cancel successive
    gates using the get_merged and get_inverse functions of the gate (if
    available). For examples, see BasicRotationGate. Once a list corresponding
    to a qubit contains >=m gates, the pipeline is sent on to the next engine.

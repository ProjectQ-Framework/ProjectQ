"""
Mapper for a quantum circuit to a linear chain of qubits.

Input: Quantum circuit with 1 and 2 qubit gates on n qubits. Gates are assumed
       to be applied in parallel if they act on disjoint qubit(s) and any pair
       of qubits can perform a 2 qubit gate (all-to-all connectivity)
Output: Quantum circuit in which qubits are placed in 1-D chain in which only
        nearest neighbour qubits can perform a 2 qubit gate. The mapper uses
        Swap gates in order to move qubits next to each other.

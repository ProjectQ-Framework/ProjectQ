"""
Defines a setup to compile to qubits placed in a linear chain or a circle.

It provides the `engine_list` for the `MainEngine`. This engine list contains
an AutoReplacer with most of the gate decompositions of ProjectQ, which are
used to decompose a circuit into only two qubit gates and arbitrary single
qubit gates. ProjectQ's LinearMapper is then used to introduce the necessary
Swap operations to route interacting qubits next to each other. This setup
allows to choose the final gate set (with some limitations).

    Returns an engine list to compile to a linear chain of qubits.

    Note:
        If you choose a new gate set for which the compiler does not yet have
        standard rules, it raises an `NoGateDecompositionError` or a
        `RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded...`. Also note that
        even the gate sets which work might not yet be optimized. So make sure
        to double check and potentially extend the decomposition rules.
        This implemention currently requires that the one qubit gates must
        contain Rz and at least one of {Ry(best), Rx, H} and the two qubit gate
        must contain CNOT (recommended) or CZ.

    Note:
        Classical instructions gates such as e.g. Flush and Measure are
        automatically allowed.

    Example:
        get_engine_list(num_qubits=10, cyclic=False,
                        one_qubit_gates=(Rz, Ry, Rx, H),
                        two_qubit_gates=(CNOT,))

    Args:
        num_qubits(int): Number of qubits in the chain
        cyclic(bool): If a circle or not. Default is False
        one_qubit_gates: "any" allows any one qubit gate, otherwise provide
                         a tuple of the allowed gates. If the gates are
                         instances of a class (e.g. X), it allows all gates
                         which are equal to it. If the gate is a class (Rz), it
                         allows all instances of this class. Default is "any"
        two_qubit_gates: "any" allows any two qubit gate, otherwise provide
                         a tuple of the allowed gates. If the gates are
                         instances of a class (e.g. CNOT), it allows all gates
                         which are equal to it. If the gate is a class, it
                         allows all instances of this class.
                         Default is (CNOT, Swap).
    Raises:
        TypeError: If input is for the gates is not "any" or a tuple.

Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA) executes the algorithm, but not
the final measurement required to obtain the marked state(s) with high
probability. The starting state on wich the QAA algorithm is executed
is the one resulting of aplying the Algorithm on the |0> state.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

       def func_algorithm(eng,system_qubits):
           All(H) | system_qubits

       def func_oracle(eng,system_qubits,qaa_ancilla):
           # This oracle selects the state |010> as the one marked
           with Compute(eng):
              All(X) | system_qubits[0::2]
           with Control(eng, system_qubits):
              X | qaa_ancilla
           Uncompute(eng)

       system_qubits = eng.allocate_qureg(3)
       # Prepare the qaa_ancilla qubit in the |-> state
       qaa_ancilla = eng.allocate_qubit()
       X | qaa_ancilla
       H | qaa_ancilla

       # Creates the initial state form the Algorithm
       func_algorithm(eng, system_qubits)
       # Apply Quantum Amplitude Amplification the correct number of times
       num_it = int(math.pi/4.*math.sqrt(1 << 3))
       with Loop(eng, num_it):
         QAA(func_algorithm, func_oracle) | (system_qubits, qaa_ancilla)

       All(Measure) | system_qubits

Warning:
    No qubit allocation/deallocation may take place during the call
    to the defined Algorithm :code:`func_algorithm`

Attributes:
    func_algorithm: Algorithm that initialite the state and to be used
                    in the QAA algorithm
    func_oracle: The Oracle that marks the state(s) as "good"
    system_qubits: the system we are interested on
    qaa_ancilla: auxiliary qubit that helps to invert the amplitude of the
                 "good" states

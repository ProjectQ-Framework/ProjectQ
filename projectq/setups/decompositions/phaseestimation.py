Registers a decomposition for phase estimation.

(reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm)

The Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) executes the algorithm up to the inverse
QFT included. The following steps measuring the ancillas and computing the
phase should be executed outside of the QPE.

The decomposition uses as ancillas (qpe_ancillas) the first qubit/qureg in
the Command and as system qubits teh second qubit/qureg in the Command.

The unitary operator for which the phase estimation is estimated (unitary)
is the gate in Command

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

       # Example using a ProjectQ gate
       
       n_qpe_ancillas = 3
       qpe_ancillas = eng.allocate_qureg(n_qpe_ancillas)
       system_qubits = eng.allocate_qureg(1)
       angle = cmath.pi*2.*0.125
       U = Ph(angle) # unitary_specfic_to_the_problem()

       # Apply Quantum Phase Estimation
       QPE(U) | (qpe_ancillas, system_qubits)

       All(Measure) | qpe_ancillas
       # Compute the phase from the ancilla measurement
       #(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm)
       phasebinlist = [int(q) for q in qpe_ancillas]
       phase_in_bin = ''.join(str(j) for j in phasebinlist)
       phase_int = int(phase_in_bin,2)
       phase = phase_int / (2 ** n_qpe_ancillas)
       print (phase)

       # Example using a function (two_qubit_gate).
       # Instead of applying QPE on a gate U one could provide a function

       def two_qubit_gate(system_q, time):
           CNOT | (system_q[0], system_q[1])
           Ph(2.0*cmath.pi*(time * 0.125)) | system_q[1]
           CNOT | (system_q[0], system_q[1])

       n_qpe_ancillas = 3
       qpe_ancillas = eng.allocate_qureg(n_qpe_ancillas)
       system_qubits = eng.allocate_qureg(2)
       X | system_qubits[0]

       # Apply Quantum Phase Estimation
       QPE(two_qubit_gate) | (qpe_ancillas, system_qubits)

       All(Measure) | qpe_ancillas
       # Compute the phase from the ancilla measurement
       #(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm)
       phasebinlist = [int(q) for q in qpe_ancillas]
       phase_in_bin = ''.join(str(j) for j in phasebinlist)
       phase_int = int(phase_in_bin,2)
       phase = phase_int / (2 ** n_qpe_ancillas)
       print (phase)

Attributes:
    unitary (BasicGate): Unitary Operation either a ProjectQ gate or a function f.
    Calling the function with the parameters system_qubits(Qureg) and time (integer),
    i.e. f(system_qubits, time), applies to the system qubits a unitary defined in f
    with parameter time.

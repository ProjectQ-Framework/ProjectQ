An exact straight forward decomposition of a TimeEvolution gate is possible
if the hamiltonian has only one term or if all the terms commute with each
other in which case one can implement each term individually.

    Implements a TimeEvolution gate with a hamiltonian having only one term.

    To implement exp(-i * t * hamiltonian), where the hamiltonian is only one
    term, e.g., hamiltonian = X0 x Y1 X Z2, we first perform local
    transformations to in order that all Pauli operators in the hamiltonian
    are Z. We then implement  exp(-i * t * (Z1 x Z2 x Z3) and transform the
    basis back to the original. For more details see, e.g.,

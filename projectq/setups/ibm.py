"""
Defines a setup useful for the IBM QE chip with 5 qubits.

It provides the `engine_list` for the `MainEngine`, and contains an
AutoReplacer with most of the gate decompositions of ProjectQ, among others
it includes:

    * Controlled z-rotations --> Controlled NOTs and single-qubit rotations
    * Toffoli gate --> CNOT and single-qubit gates
    * m-Controlled global phases --> (m-1)-controlled phase-shifts
    * Global phases --> ignore
    * (controlled) Swap gates --> CNOTs and Toffolis
    * Arbitrary single qubit gates --> Rz and Ry
    * Controlled arbitrary single qubit gates --> Rz, Ry, and CNOT gates

Moreover, it contains `LocalOptimizers` and a custom mapper for the CNOT
gates.

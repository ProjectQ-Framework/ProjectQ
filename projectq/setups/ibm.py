"""
Registers a variety of useful gate decompositions, specifically for the IBM
quantum experience backend. Among others it includes:

    * Controlled z-rotations --> Controlled NOTs and single-qubit rotations
    * Toffoli gate --> CNOT and single-qubit gates
    * m-Controlled global phases --> (m-1)-controlled phase-shifts
    * Global phases --> ignore
    * (controlled) Swap gates --> CNOTs and Toffolis

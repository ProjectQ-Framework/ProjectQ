"""
Defines a setup allowing to compile code for the IBM quantum chips:
->Any 5 qubit devices
->the ibmq online simulator
->the melbourne 15 qubit device

It provides the `engine_list` for the `MainEngine' based on the requested
device.  Decompose the circuit into a Rx/Ry/Rz/H/CNOT gate set that will be
translated in the backend in the U1/U2/U3/CX gate set.

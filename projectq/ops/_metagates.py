    Wrapper class allowing to execute the inverse of a gate, even when it does

    If there is a replacement available, then there is also one for the

    all gates. This class enables using this emulation automatically.

    A DaggeredGate is returned automatically when employing the get_inverse-
    function on a gate which does not provide a get_inverse() member function.

                MySpecialGate | qubits

    will create a DaggeredGate if MySpecialGate does not implement
    get_inverse. If there is a decomposition function available, an auto-
    replacer engine can automatically replace the inverted gate by a call to
    the decomposition function inside a "with Dagger"-statement.

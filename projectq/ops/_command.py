This file defines the apply_command function and the Command class.

When a gate is applied to qubits, e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

    CNOT | (qubit1, qubit2)

a Command object is generated which represents both the gate, qubits and
control qubits. This Command object then gets sent down the compilation
pipeline.

In detail, the Gate object overloads the operator| (magic method __or__)
to generate a Command object which stores the qubits in a canonical order
using interchangeable qubit indices defined by the gate to allow the
optimizer to cancel the following two gates

.. code-block:: python
    Swap | (qubit1, qubit2)
    Swap | (qubit2, qubit1)

The command then gets sent to the MainEngine via the
apply wrapper (apply_command).

    Class used as a container to store commands. If a gate is applied to
    qubits, then the gate and qubits are saved in a command object. Qubits
    are copied into WeakQubitRefs in order to allow early deallocation (would
    be kept alive otherwise). WeakQubitRef qubits don't send deallocate gate
    when destructed.

    Attributes:
        gate: The gate to execute
        qubits: Tuple of qubit lists (e.g. Quregs). Interchangeable qubits
                  are stored in a unique order
        control_qubits: The Qureg of control qubits in a unique order
        engine: The engine (usually: MainEngine)
        tags: The list of tag objects associated with this command
          (e.g., ComputeTag, UncomputeTag, LoopTag, ...). tag objects need to
          support ==, != (__eq__ and __ne__) for comparison as used in e.g.
          TagRemover. New tags should always be added to the end of the list.
          This means that if there are e.g. two LoopTags in a command, tag[0]
          is from the inner scope while tag[1] is from the other scope as the
          other scope receives the command after the inner scope LoopEngine
          and hence adds its LoopTag to the end.

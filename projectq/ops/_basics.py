Defines the BasicGate class, the base class of all gates, the
BasicRotationGate class, the SelfInverseGate, the FastForwardingGate, the
ClassicalInstruction gate, and the BasicMathGate class.

Gates overload the | operator to allow the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    Gate | (qureg1, qureg2, qureg2)
    Gate | (qureg, qubit)
    Gate | qureg
    Gate | qubit
    Gate | (qubit,)

This means that for more than one quantum argument (right side of | ), a tuple
needs to be made explicitely, while for one argument it is optional.

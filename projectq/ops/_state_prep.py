        Initialize StatePreparation gate.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                qureg = eng.allocate_qureg(2)
                StatePreparation([0.5, -0.5j, -0.5, 0.5]) | qureg

        Note:
            The amplitude of state k is final_state[k]. When the state k is
            written in binary notation, then qureg[0] denotes the qubit
            whose state corresponds to the least significant bit of k.

            final_state(list[complex]): wavefunction of the desired
                                        quantum state. len(final_state) must
                                        be 2**len(qureg). Must be normalized!

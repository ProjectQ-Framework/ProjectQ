ProjectQ - An open source software framework for quantum computing

Get started:
    Simply import the main compiler engine (from projectq import MainEngine)
    together with your setup of choice (e.g., import projectq.setups.default)
    and start coding!

    For examples, see the example folder, which features implementation of
    a quantum random number generator, entanglement demonstration (simulation
    or run on the IBM backend), Teleportation, Grover search, and
    Shor's algorithm for factoring.

Contains back-ends for ProjectQ.

This includes:

* a debugging tool to print all received commands (CommandPrinter)
* a circuit drawing engine (which can be used anywhere within the compilation
  chain)
* a simulator with emulation capabilities
* a resource counter (counts gates and keeps track of the maximal width of the
  circuit)
* an interface to the IBM Quantum Experience chip (and simulator).

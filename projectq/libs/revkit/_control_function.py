class ControlFunctionOracle:
    """
    Synthesizes a negation controlled by an arbitrary control function.

    This creates a circuit for a NOT gate which is controlled by an arbitrary
    Boolean control function.  The control function is provided as integer
    representation of the function's truth table in binary notation.  For
    example, for the majority-of-three function, which truth table 11101000,
    the value for function can be, e.g., ``0b11101000``, ``0xe8``, or ``232``.

    Example:

        This example creates a circuit that causes to invert qubit ``d``,
        the majority-of-three function evaluates to true for the control
        qubits ``a``, ``b``, and ``c``.

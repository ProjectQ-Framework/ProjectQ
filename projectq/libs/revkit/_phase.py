class PhaseOracle:
    """
    Synthesizes phase circuit from an arbitrary Boolean function.

    This creates a phase circuit from a Boolean function.  It inverts the phase
    of all amplitudes for which the function evaluates to 1.  The Boolean
    function is provided as integer representation of the function's truth
    table in binary notation.  For example, for the majority-of-three function,
    which truth table 11101000, the value for function can be, e.g.,
    ``0b11101000``, ``0xe8``, or ``232``.

    Note that a phase circuit can only accurately be found for a normal
    function, i.e., a function that maps the input pattern 0, 0, ..., 0 to 0.
    The circuits for a function and its inverse are the same.

    Example:

        This example creates a phase circuit based on the majority-of-three
        function on qubits ``a``, ``b``, and ``c``.

    "Our simulator can be used to simulate any circuit model quantum algorithm. This requires storing the state, also called wavefunction, of all qubits which requires storing 2<sup>n</sup> complex values (each of size 16 bytes) for an *n*-qubit algorithm. This can get very expensive in terms of required RAM:\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of qubits you can simulate with the ProjectQ simulator is only limited by the amount of RAM in your notebook or workstation. Applying quantum gates is expensive as we have to potentially update each individual value in the full wavefunction. Therefore, we have implemented a high-performance simulator which is significantly faster than other simulators (see our papers for a detailed comparison [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08091), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06460)). The performance of such simulators is hardware-dependent and therefore we have decided to provide 4 different versions. A simulator implemented in C++ which uses multi-threading (OpenMP) and instrinsics, a C++ simulator which uses intrinsics, a C++ simulator, and a slower simulator which only uses Python. During the installation we try to install the fastest of these options given your hardware and available compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulator is simultaneously also a quantum emulator. This concept was first introduced by us in [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06460). A quantum emulator takes classical shortcuts when performing the simulation and hence can be orders of magnitude faster. E.g., for simulating Shor's algorithm, we only require to store the wavefunction of *n+1* qubits while the algorithm on a real quantum computer would require *2n+O(1)* qubits. Using these emulation capabilities, we can easily emulate Shor's algorithm for factoring, e.g., 4028033 = 2003 · 2011 on a notebook [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08091)."

    "This program randomly outputs 0 or 1. Note that the measurement does *not* return for example a probability of measuring 0 or 1 (see below how this could be achieved). The reason for this is that a program written in our high-level syntax should be independent of the backend. In other words, the code can be executed either by our simulator or by exchanging only the MainEngine's backend by a real device which cannot return a probability but only one value. See the other examples on GitHub of how to execute code on the IBM quantum chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note on eng.flush()\n",
    "Note that we have used eng.flush() which tells the compiler to send all the instructions to the backend. In a simplified version, when the Python interpreter executes a gate (e.g. the above lines with H, or Measure), this gate is sent to the compiler (MainEngine), where it is cached. Compilation and optimization of cached gates happens irregularly, e.g., an optimizer in the compiler might wait for 5 gates before it starts the optimization process. Therefore, if we require the result of a quantum program, we need to call eng.flush() which tells the compiler to compile and send all cached gates to the backend for execution. eng.flush() is therefore necessary when accessing the measurement result by converting the qubit object to an int or bool. Or when using the advanced features below, where we want to access properties of the wavefunction at a specific point in the quantum algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above statement is not entirely correct as for example there is no eng.flush() strictly required before accessing the measurement result. The reason is that the measurement gate in our compiler is not cached but is sent directly to the local simulator backend because it would allow for performance optimizations by shrinking the wavefunction. However, this is not a feature which your code should/can rely on and therefore you should always use eng.flush()."

This is an important debugging feature as in many quantum algorithms, ancilla qubits are used for intermediate results and then \"uncomputed\" back into state |0>.

If possible we are planning to change the C++ simulator to also return a reference which currently is not possible due to the python export. Please keep this difference in mind when writing code. If you require a copy, it is safest to make a copy of the objects returned by the `cheat` method.\n",

Which bitlocation a specific qubit in the wavefunction has is not predefined (e.g. by the order of qubit allocation) but is rather chosen depending on the compiler optimizations and the simulator. Therefore, `cheat` also returns a dictionary containing the mapping of qubit id to bit location in the wavefunction. Here is a small example:"

Examples and Tutorials
======================

This folder contains a collection of **examples** and **tutorials** for how to use ProjectQ. They offer a great way to get started. While this collection is growing, it will never by possible to cover everything. Therefore, we refer the reader to also have a look at:

* Our complete **code documentation** which can be found online `here <http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. Besides the newest version of the documentation it also provides older versions. Moreover, these docs can be downloaded for offline usage.

* Our **unit tests**. You hear right, all our code is tested! In fact more than 99% of all the code lines are covered with various unit tests since the first release. Tests are that important to us (not like in other projects where tests are added every now and then...). Therefore, if you are wondering how a specific feature can be used, have a look at the **unit tests**, where you can find plenty of example usages. Finding the unit tests is very easy, e.g., the tests of the simulator implemented in *ProjectQ/projectq/backends/_sim/_simulator.py* can all be found in the same folder in the file *ProjectQ/projectq/backends/_sim/_simulator_test.py*.

Getting started / background information
----------------------------------------

It might be a good starting point to have a look at our paper which explains the goals of the ProjectQ framework and also gives a good overview:

* Damian S. Steiger, Thomas HÃ¤ner, and Matthias Troyer "ProjectQ: An Open Source Software Framework for Quantum Computing" `[arxiv:1612.08091] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08091>`__

Examples and tutorials in this folder
-------------------------------------

1. Some of the files in this folder are explained in the `documentation <http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`__.

2. Take a look at the *simulator_tutorial.ipynb* for a detailed introduction to most of the features of our high performance quantum simulator.

3. Running on the IBM QE chip is explained in more details in *ibm_entangle.ipynb*.

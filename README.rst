ProjectQ is an open source effort for quantum computing.

It features a compilation framework capable of
targeting various types of hardware, a high-performance quantum computer
simulator with emulation capabilities, and various compiler plug-ins.
This allows users to

-  run quantum programs on the IBM Quantum Experience chip
-  simulate quantum programs on classical computers
-  emulate quantum programs at a higher level of abstraction (e.g.,
   mimicking the action of large oracles instead of compiling them to
   low-level gates)
-  export quantum programs as circuits (using TikZ)
-  get resource estimates

Getting started
---------------

To start using ProjectQ, simply follow the installation instructions in the `tutorials <http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>`__. There, you will also find OS-specific hints, a small introduction to the ProjectQ syntax, and a few `code examples <http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`__. More example codes and tutorials can be found in the examples folder `here <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ/tree/develop/examples>`__ on GitHub.

Also, make sure to check out the `ProjectQ
website <http://www.projectq.ch>`__ and the detailed `code documentation <http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
